## Submitting changes

After opening a Github pull request on the repo you'd like to update, be sure to:

* Update documentation, including the README.md file, any additional documentation under `/docs`, and any separate documentation sites that cover the functionality.
* Check that you added test coverage for any changes you made.
* Check if your changes break an API. If so, increment the version and ensure that any current dependents will not break.

Always write a clear log messages for your commits.
